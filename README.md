# Back-end With JavaScript
Learning node, EJS, mongoDB and more

If you want to copy my code and play around with it to learn more you need to have knowledge of JavaScript first.

This repository is intended to help me look back in the future and see how far i've come, hopefully you can also be inspired and learn a thing or two from it.
